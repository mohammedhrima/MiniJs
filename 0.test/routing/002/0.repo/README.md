### A Quick Test-Drive

To give the completed code a quick test-drive:

1. Install Node.js
2. Navigate to the project folder and run the following from a terminal:
   - `npm init -y` (to create a Node.js project)
   - `npm i express` (to install Express)
   - `node server.js` (to run the server)
3. Open `localhost` in a web browser, using the port specified in `server.js` e.g. http://localhost:3000/

> Refer to the **YouTube Tutorial** for step-by-step instructions to create the code. Enjoy! :)
